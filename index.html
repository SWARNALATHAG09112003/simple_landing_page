                <p> <em>Steven Paul Jobs</em> (born Abdul Lateef Jandali; February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an
                    American
                    business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the
                    chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors
                    following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of
                    the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and
                    fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.<br><br>
                    On Oct. 5, 2011, Steve Jobs passed away at the age of 56.
                    He had just left the CEO post at Apple, the company he co-founded, for the second time. Jobs was an
                    entrepreneur through and through, and the story of his rise is the story of Apple as a company,
                    along with some very interesting twists. In this article, we'll look at the career of Steve Jobs and
                    the company he founded, as well as some of the lessons Apple offers for potential entrepreneurs.
